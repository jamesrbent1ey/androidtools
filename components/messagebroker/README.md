# Message Broker
A simple publish-subscribe broker based on String topics
Each topic is associated with an Exchange. The Exchange provides message queuing and delivery.

The Publish-subscribe (broker pattern) is invaluable for systems that need to loosely couple components.
This need is typically discovered in systems where requirements are volatile (changing frequently).
